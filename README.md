## How To Validate Solutions üïπÔ∏è

1.  **Install Foundry**

First run the command below to get foundryup, the Foundry toolchain installer:

``` bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your PATH, run it to get the latest forge and cast binaries:

``` console
foundryup
```
Advanced ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found in the [foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md)

2. **Clone This Repo and install dependencies**
``` 
git clone https://github.com/nicolasgarcia214/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry.git
cd damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry
forge install
```

3. **Run the exploit for a challenge**
```
make [CONTRACT_LEVEL_NAME]
```
or
```
./run.sh [LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME]
./run.sh [CHALLENGE_NUMBER]
./run.sh [4_FIRST_LETTER_OF_NAME] 
```
